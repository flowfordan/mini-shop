    You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. 
    Those are all just excuses.
    What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way.
    You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.`,

    coverImage: 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/0672326140.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg',
    about:
    `Imagine, at a terrifyingly aggressive rate, everything you regularly use is being equipped with computer technology. 
    Think about your phone, cameras, cars-everything-being automated and programmed by people who in their rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, 
    have abdicated their responsibility to make these products easy to use. 
    The Inmates Are Running the Asylum argues that the business executives who make the decisions to develop these products are not 
    the ones in control of the technology used to create them. Insightful and entertaining, The Inmates Are Running the Asylum uses the author's
    experiences in corporate America to illustrate how talented people continuously design bad software-based products and why we need technology
    to work the way average people think. Somewhere out there is a happy medium that makes these types of products both user and bottom-line friendly; 
    this book discusses why we need to quickly find that medium.`
